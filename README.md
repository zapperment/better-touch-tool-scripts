# better-touch-tool-scripts

This repository contains some JavaScript code, to be used with the “Real JavaScript” action in
[Better Touch Tool](https://folivora.ai).

To use any of the scripts, you need to build them using the `yarn build` command. The scripts will then be
available in the _dist_ folder for you to copy over to BTT.
